Usage
------
probekins will offset your Z based on probe.txt in reference to the machine absolute coordinates.
Clear all XY offsets so that the probe moves are your machine coords.
choose the number, and distance between probe moves, with the 4 spinboxes.
click "probe area and load" this will run probestl.ngc with your settings to probe the area.
I probe mostly flat surfaces, so if you have a lot of Z variance you may need to edit the probe speeds and heights.
after probing it will rapid to the start point, now click "enable Z correction"
any jogs or movement will now move the Z to match your probed surface.
following errors will be a problem if there are rapid changes in the correction, so watch out.

Caution
-------
On my machine, sometimes it will randomly quit while probing with no errors.
Then at some point in the future, when clicking a button the machine will move X a few inches positive.
Not at all sure why this happens, hopefully it wont happen to you, I dont think it is anything with these files, but it's possible.

Install
-------

custompanel.xml
add this to your existing file
note that although you can enter numbers into the pyvcp spinboxes, they arent recognized.
you have to use the scroll wheel for the numbers to stick.

main.ini
add these lines to your machine ini file
note that if you have mdi commands already specified, you will need to edit custom_postgui.hal to give them the right numbers.

custom_postgui.hal
add this to your custom_postgui.hal

main.hal
add this to your machine hal file
note the comments in the file for memory size and analog inputs

probestl.ngc
copy this file to your [DISPLAY]program_prefix directory.
note line 47 probe move at f250. may need to lower speed for your config
note variables #7 and #8 for Z safe height, and probe depth, change if needed
note log lines near end of file, these are to add machine boundaries as Z0 to help reduce following errors.

M100, M101, M102
copy these files to [DISPLAY]program_prefix directory.
make sure they are executable
in M102 edit -b numbers to match your machine limits


follow the directions to install probekins @
http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ProbeKins

in the archive directory /bin
sudo cp * /usr/bin
(copy all files to /usr/bin as root)
I have changed the names to match the documentation, as they are different as downloaded from the website.

If your Z moves in the wrong direction in response to the correction, replace your probekins.ko with the probekins-invert.ko
